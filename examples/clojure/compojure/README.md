# Pun-Tracker

Example using Clojure, Compojure, Enlive, Datomic and others.

## Usage

Clone the repository and start the application...

```
lein run
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:3000/

## Notes

As the moment Clojure doesn't really have a defacto web framework like
other languages.  It generally favours composing smaller solutions.

There are a bunch of attempts to create this kind of thing, the latest
being [Pedestal](http://pedestal.io/), but this application largely
implements typical 'out of the box' functionality itself, using libraries
where it makes sense.
